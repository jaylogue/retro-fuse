	The device drivers in this directory are here because they are untested,
or have not been completely converted to use new ioctl or buffering protocols,
or because they are of limited interest or use.  Some of them have comments
at the beginning describing their state.  If you test and/or finish
any of these drivers, please let the 2BSD project know about it.

The dc and dj drivers don't have the current ioctl mechanism.
They are untested.

The dmc and du drivers don't know how to handle system buffers, since there
are no in-address-space buffers any longer.  They could probably be made to
work with dedicated buffers or mapped-in buffers.
bk (berknet line discipline) also has this problem, but will probably
be converted and tested soon.  It has never worked on PDP11's to my knowledge.

The rx2, rx3 and ml drivers have been modified only slightly
from working versions received from the authors.  They will probably
work without modification.

The multiplexor driver has not been made to work with anything like the
current system.  It is unmodified (as far as I know); if you try it,
check the order and types of arguments to the external entry points.

The cr (card reader) driver is probably flaky, at least with this system.
